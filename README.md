# NaDA
Nanopore Data Analysis(NaDA) is a bachelor internship program, focussing on analysing and visualization of ctDNA for a p53 mutant database. NaDA provides a range of python scripts able to analyse single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both fastq and vcf files derived from nanopore sequencing.

# Documentation
