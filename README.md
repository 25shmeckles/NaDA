# NaDA
Nanopore Data Analysis(NaDA) is a bachelor internship program, focussing on analysing and visualization of ctDNA for a p53 mutant database. NaDA provides a range of python scripts able to analyse single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both fastq and vcf files derived from nanopore sequencing.

# Documentation
further documentation about NaDA can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DouweSpaanderman/NaDA/blob/master/Documentation/build/html/index.html) and for more background information my literature studie reveals more about the importance of ctDNA analysis.
